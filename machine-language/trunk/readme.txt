Admin page debugger tool

== Description ==

Toggles human and machine language (aka IDs) on admin pages.

= Only for development! =

This plugin shows you the IDs of almost all form fields including selects, checkboxes and radio buttons.

It works only on WordPress Settings API-like formatted - not necessarily API generated - admin pages.
E.g. the `<input>`-s cannot be wrapped in `<span>`-s.

= Activation =

You can find the plugin's checkbox in standard Screen Options (upper right corner).
This checkbox could be overwritten - thus hidden - by poorly written plugins.
To restrict Machine Language to a certain admin page, put a line like this in wp-config.php:

`define( 'MACHINE_LANGUAGE_HOOK', 'load-options-reading.php' );`

This line causes to run only on Settings / Reading.

= Features =

* Basicly all input IDs are displayed in place of labels, really not input IDs but `for` attributes of labels
* Selects get a title showing all option values (comma separated)
* Options get values appended in the form of "original option text|value"
* Radio button labels will show: "name|value"
* Descriptions (`p`-s and `span`-s with "description" class) will he hidden, it will clean up all admin pages,
descriptions are hidden by CSS, so there's no [FUOC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content)

= Other notes =

* Radio buttons or checkboxes with empty value are displayed with the "Empty Set"
Unicode character: "∅" (U+2205) (e.g. Settings / Permalinks / Default )
* Selects with empty values are not
* The plugin's checkbox in Screen Options is effective immediately
* The code is designed as a must use plugin, so there is no separated Javascript file
* State of Machine Language is saved as a user option so it is a per user setting

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I inspect form fields not altered? =

Even if your admin page is not generated by the [Setting API](https://github.com/voceconnect/voce-settings-api)
you should output HTML like in WordPress Settings pages.

= Use in production? =

Please don't!
